A series of **ReactJS coding challenges** with a variety of difficulties. Deep dive into the why [here](https://dev.to/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges-for-interviews-beginners-1hlk).

## How do they work / how do I get started?
The scaffolding of each challenges / app is done for you and each challenge has *create-react-app* as its foundation.

- Clone the whole challenges repository
- CD into Spootify
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the application on port 3000 (CRA default)
- All the requirements have been completed

*Some challenges might require usage of external APIs, but all information will be provided in the individual challenge readme.*
